# Darktools Page

This GitHub page collects the material for the hands-on session at the DarkTools Workshop in Torino: https://agenda.irmp.ucl.ac.be/event/5375/

The workshop explores the multidisciplinary study of dark matter through direct and indirect detection, collider searches, and cosmological observations, with a focus on integrating these approaches with widely used dark matter tools. Participants will gain insights into the current state of dark matter research and the computational tools driving progress in the field.

The program includes hands-on sessions for practical experience with these tools, as well as round-table discussions aimed at shaping future developments to meet the evolving needs of the dark matter community.

The materials provided here are related to the following tools:

DarkSUSY, FeynRules, MadDM, MadGraph, MARTY and DarkPack, micrOMEGAs, LanHep e Calchep, (...)
