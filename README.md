# Darktools Page

This github page is intended to collect the material for the hands-on session that will take place at the DarkTools workshop in Torino: https://agenda.irmp.ucl.ac.be/event/5375/
This workshop explores the multidisciplinary study of dark matter through direct and indirect detection, collider searches, and cosmological observations, with a focus on their integration with widely used dark matter tools. Participants will gain insights into the current status of dark matter research and the tools that underpin advancements in the field.

The program features hands-on sessions for practical engagement with these tools and round-table discussions to explore future developments, to align them with the evolving needs of the dark matter community.

The material stored here is related to the following tools:

DarkSUSY
FeynRules
MadDM
MadGraph
MARTY and DarkPack
micrOMEGAs
